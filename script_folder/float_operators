num1=20.5

#shell scripting does not support arithmetic operations on float numbers so in order to perform arithmetic operations on floating numbers we need to make use of bc

echo "20.5+49.8" | bc
echo $num2-num1 | bc
echo "20.5/10.8" | bc

#the above expression means that we are passing the strings on the left as an input for the bc
#if we want to set the amount of decimal places we make use of the "scale" variable

echo "scale=4;$num2/$num1" | bc

#always use the scale variable when dividing a float number

#to find the square root of a number you can use the "sqrt" function and then include the math library with the "-l" flag

num=30
echo "scale=2;sqrt($num)" | bc -l

#to find the power of a number you can use the ^ symbol
echo "scale=3;$num^$num" | bc -l
